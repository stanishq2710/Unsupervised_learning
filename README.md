## 📊 Algorithms Covered

### 1. K-Means Clustering
- Partitions data into `k` groups.
- Uses **elbow method** to select the optimal number of clusters.
- Visualizations included using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### 2. Agglomerative Clustering
- Hierarchical clustering approach.
- Dendrogram generation with `scipy.cluster.hierarchy`.
- Visual grouping of data into a hierarchy.

### 3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Technique for dimensionality reduction.
- Projects data into lower-dimensional space while preserving variance.
- Useful for visualization and preprocessing.
